#### The world in 2018

- gloomy threat picture globally
- global incidents and campaigns with large scale impacts
- WannaCry and NotPetya wake-up calls @EU
- Public(Collective) attribution of malicious cyber activities - inseparable part of international relations

<br>

#### Existing international law applies in cyberspace
- UN GGE 2015 report - a credible basis for international normative framework States should
- Cooperate in developing and applying measures to increase stability and security in the use of ICTs and to prevent ICT practices that are acknowledged to be harmful or that may pose threats to international peace and security;
- not knowingly allow their ternitory to be used for internationally wrongful acts using ICTs
- not conduct or knowingly support ICT activity contrary to its obligations under international law that intentionally damages critical infrastructure or otherwise impairs the use and operation of critical infrastructure to provide services to the public;
- seek to prevent the proliferation of malicious ICT tools and techniques and the use of harmful hidden functions;

<br>

#### Raising the cost of malicious cyber activities
- We have to change the calculation of governments who either organize the attacks, or just allow them to happen on their digital infrastructure
   - President of Estonia, May 2018
- United States should working with likeminded partners when possible, adopt and approach of imposing swift, costly, and transparent consequences on foreign governments responsiible for significant malicious cyber activities
   - Recommendations to the President on Deterring Adversaries and Better Protection the American People from Cyber Threats, Office of the Coordinator for Cyber Issues. May 2018

<br>

#### EU and its cyber diplomacy toolbox
- a common and comprehensive EU approach for cyber diplomacy could contribute to conflict prevention, the mitigation of cybersecurity threats and greater stability in international relations
   - Council of the EU, Febuary 2015
- EU affirms that measures within the Common Foreign and Security Policy, including, if necessary, restrictive measures, adopted under the relevant provisions of the Treaties, are suitable for a Framework for a joint EU diplomatic response to malicious cyber activities and should encourage cooperation, facilitate mitigation of immediate and long-term threats, and influence the behavior of potential aggressors in a long term
   - Council of the EU, June 2017

<br>

#### Tools in the toolbox
- Forms of diplomatic, political or economic actions that can be used to prevent or respond to a malicious cyber activity, including in case of malicious cybe r activities that do not rise to the level of internationally wrongful acts but are considered as unfriendly acts
- Ffrom awareness raising and capacity building 
- to statements and demarches
- to restrictive measures such as freezing funds or travel bans

<br>

#### ... and using them
- Tools can be used independently, sequentially or in parallel and toolbox is a whole
- Could be used also to prevent or respond to malicious cyber activities which may originate from a State or non-state actor or transit through a States' territory, if that State knowingly allows its territory to be used for such activity or knowingly supports it.
- EU reaction can start based on impact and when attribution is still on-going

<br>

#### So where are we now @EU?
- EU firmly condemns the malicious use of information and communications technologies(ICTs), including in Wannacry and NotPetya, which have caused significant damage and economic loss in the EU and beyond. Such incidents are destabilizing cyberspace as well as the physical world as they can be easily misperceived and could trigger cascading events
   - Foreign Affairs Council, April 2018

<br>

#### Lessons learned so far
- Toolbox - the approach in the region of EU
- Potential for other regional approaches and learning from eachother
- A need to enhance shared understanding between states on how attribution is conducted
- Bringing technical and political attribution together is a tough challenge, but not impossible

<br>

#### To conclude
- Need to mutually raise expectations between technical and political/diplomatic communities
- More cooperation between democratic likeminded states is an absolute must
